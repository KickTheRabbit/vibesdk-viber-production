CHANGES:
- Added detailed debug logging to queueCostEvent() function

- Helps diagnose why blueprint/templateSelection/firstPhaseImplementation events don't reach frontend

FILES MODIFIED:
1. worker/agents/planning/blueprint.ts
2. worker/agents/planning/templateSelector.ts

DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
- MUST clear Cloudflare build cache after deploy
- Test with new project creation
- Check Cloudflare Worker logs for debug output
- Compare browser console events (should see all events if fix works)
